# Loan-Interest-Rate-Prediction

The project focus on Data preparationa and Data Cleaning Process. It includes feature engineering, string processing, data type transforming.
The missing value or irrelated columnn will be replaced and if the data columns contains too much of missing value, it will be removed as well.
 
The goal for the project is to build machine learning models in Python to predict the interest rates assigned to loans. We will also evaluate the model performances using RSME to choose the best model.
